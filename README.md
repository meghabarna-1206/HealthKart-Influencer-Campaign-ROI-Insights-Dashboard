# HealthKart-Influencer-Campaign-ROI-Insights-Dashboard

This project is a comprehensive analytics solution built to simulate, track, and visualize influencer marketing performance for HealthKart. The system measures key metrics like ROI, Incremental ROAS, influencer effectiveness, and campaign-level insights using SQL-based data modeling and a dashboard interface.

## 📌 Project Overview
Influencer marketing is critical for brand visibility and growth. This open-source project helps HealthKart:

- Track campaign performance across platforms (Instagram, YouTube, Twitter)
- Analyze influencer performance (reach, revenue, ROAS)
- Compute ROI & Incremental ROAS
- Gain actionable insights on products, platforms, and personas

## 🗂 Dataset Overview
  
The project uses simulated data to represent HealthKart’s influencer campaigns across platforms like Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter. The datasets include influencer profiles, social media post metrics, user-level conversion tracking, and payout structures. Together, these tables enable full-funnel performance analysis — from reach and engagement to revenue and ROAS.

## 🧱 Data Model
Four core datasets were simulated:

- **influencers:**	Influencer profiles with category, gender, follower count, and platform
- **posts:**	Post-level metrics: reach, likes, comments
- **tracking_data:**	User-level conversions attributed to influencer campaigns
- **payouts:**	Payout contracts (per post / per order) and amounts paid

## 🧠 Assumptions

### 1. Influencer Identification

- Each influencer is uniquely identified by influencer_id.
- The same influencer may post on multiple platforms but is counted once in influencers.

### 2. Tracking Attribution

- Every tracked order in tracking_data is attributed to a single influencer using influencer_id.
- Orders and revenue in tracking_data come only from campaign traffic (i.e., paid posts).

### 3. Payouts

- Influencer payouts are based either on per post or per order.
- If basis is post, payout = rate × number_of_posts.
- If basis is order, payout = rate × number_of_orders.

### 3. Campaign-Level Metrics

- ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) = Total Revenue / Total Payout
- Incremental ROAS is assumed to be close to standard ROAS because we do not simulate a control group or organic baseline in this version.
- All revenue figures are assumed to be post-discount and net of returns.

### 4. Post Engagement

- Engagement metrics (likes, comments, reach) are simulated but assumed accurate.
- Posts with zero engagement are still valid and may be boosted content or brand-generated.

### 5. Platform Differences

- Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter posts vary in engagement and performance.
- Influencer platform is the main platform for their identity and tracking, even if they post on other platforms.


## 🖥️ Setup

### 1. Table Creation

```sql

CREATE TABLE influencers (
    influencer_id VARCHAR(10) PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),

    gender VARCHAR(10),
    follower_count INT,
    platform VARCHAR(50)
);
```

```sql
#Posts Table
CREATE TABLE posts (
    post_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    influencer_id VARCHAR(10),
    platform VARCHAR(50),
    post_date DATE,
    url TEXT,
    caption TEXT,
    reach INT,
    likes INT,
    comments INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (influencer_id) REFERENCES influencers(influencer_id)
);
```

```sql
#Tracking Data
CREATE TABLE tracking_data (
    tracking_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    source VARCHAR(50),
    campaign VARCHAR(50),
    influencer_id VARCHAR(10),
    user_id UUID,
    product VARCHAR(100),
    order_date DATE,
    orders INT,
    revenue FLOAT,
    FOREIGN KEY (influencer_id) REFERENCES influencers(influencer_id)
);
```

```sql
#Payouts Table
CREATE TABLE payouts (
    payout_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    influencer_id VARCHAR(10),
    basis VARCHAR(10), -- 'post' or 'order'
    rate FLOAT,
    orders INT,
    total_payout FLOAT,
    FOREIGN KEY (influencer_id) REFERENCES influencers(influencer_id)
);
```

### 2. Data Import
Open MySQL Workbench → Select your database (e.g., healthkart) → Right-click on a table (e.g., influencers) → Table Data Import Wizard → Browse and select your CSV file → Match CSV columns with table columns → Click Next → Next → Finish.
Repeat this for each table.
